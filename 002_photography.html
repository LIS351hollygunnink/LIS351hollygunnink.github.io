  <H3> Capitol, 2018, Photography </H3>
  <H4> This is a photograph I took during my senior year of high school.  This photo is the dome of Wisconsin's Capitol building.  I used photoshop to edit and manipulate the original colors of the photo. </H4>  

<img src="Altered.jpg" alt="Photo composition project combining old and new photographs of the beach." width="300">

  <H3> Culture Clash, 2019, Photomontage </H3>
  <H4> This photomontage was created during my freshman year at UW for Art 107.  I used photoshop to combine a vintage photograph with more recent images, such as a volleyball and a parasailor.  </H4>
